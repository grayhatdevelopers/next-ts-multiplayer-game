This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) multiplayer game project bootstrapped with [`create-multiplayer-game`](https://github.com/grayhatdevelopers/create-multiplayer-game).

## Features
- PlayroomKit integrated
- Some base components needed for games
- Some basic routing, good for games

### Help needed
- Currently, the gameState is managed by a multiplayer state in PlayroomKit called "gameState". Would be cool to manage this with routes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
